**Note**: Please kindly have a look at 2 files of this project, including: 
- Python notebook: Olist Analysis and Insight (saved in the project repository), which includes the most important results of my analysis.
- Final presentation with Tableau visualization as [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ntSJsxE3F2aJbcrWyPLERoG9EfCcCvG/view?usp=sharing)
If you're looking for general investigation regarding Olist Dataset, you may also find some overall information in the Python Notebook Olist EDA <br><br>

**Background**: What are the Top 5 States / Peak Time? Why should we seriously focus? Are there any problems related to Orders and Delivery in those areas in Peak Time?

Olist recently experienced a Peak phase, when its order volume and revenue substantially increased in two of the previous three months. To get ready for the next cycle, the performance of Peak Time would be re-evaluated in the five states with the liveliest e-commerce activity on Olist.

This analysis will provide an overview of E-commerce performance in Peak Time, as well as help managers be aware of deep-down late delivery problems in some potential business areas.

**1. Target Audience**: Business/Logistics Analyst Manager of Olist
   
**2. Metric**: 
- **Number of Orders (Order Quantity, Order Q)**
- **% Change of Orders** (*of a month*) = Order Q (*this month) -* Order Q *(previous month)* / Order Q (*previous month*) *100%
- **Ratio of Late Orders** = Late Orders / Total Orders (*same criteria*) *100%

**3. Flow of analysis**:
- Find out what and why we should focus on **Top 5 States**, **Peak Time.**
- Analyze performance in the Top 5 States, in Peak Time, including:
    - Analysis by **Category**
    - Analysis by **Location**
    - Particular **delivery problems** which should be considered.
